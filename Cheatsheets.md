<kbd>Left</kbd> and <kbd>right click</kbd> only on links (It absolutely require any extension that can copy the link(s) in the clipboard with <kbd>Control + c</kbd> preferably as default, even wrongly, redundant or deformed and altered values like hidden, missing, or not existent).
If other prerequisite are really posing a problem like extensions, you can considerate this script can do all it alone.

**PLEASE CONSIDER THERE IS NO UPDATES FOR THE TITLES BASED ON HOTKEYS DIRECTLY, THERE IS A DOCUMENTATION SPECIFIC FOR THE KEY SETS NOW, JUST REMEMBER IT IS LIKE MANY MORE USAGES CAN BE ASSIGNED TO THE ALL THE SAME AND EVEN MORE**

On links only, note a single left any time in Google will open a new in the foreground.

On links only, note a single left any time in Google will open a new in the foreground.
---
Left normal = open link in current page
Left a little longer = open the link in another page in the background and try open if a link is below since the release of the left, if already not or move the mouse until a release, for visited links, see the dark theme project and chapter in this Git account.
Right normal = open directly the link hover the page in a new focused page loaded in a *tab*.
<kbd>Drag</kbd> away a link and <kbd>drop</kbd> the mouse <kbd>left click release status</kbd> hover it to open the URL in a new window, cause the <kbd>long left click</kbd> let the <kbd>shift key down</kbd> until any other <kbd>key</kbd> occurs, just like to activate one of the select text mode.


Rights click is special, here are all its triggers.
---

Greatest easeness utility is copy intuitively and promptely, the current selected text, there is no specials timing rules to retain, one of the normal menu need more or less pressure.

 - The shortest <kbd>click</kbd> reload the script, it will close any right menus in this case, as it will bring window over the task-bar but window is unfocused, you can directly <kbd>right click</kbd> in it and the menu will not close, the menu anyway will be <kbd>scrollable</kbd> inside it or outside, in case of problems you can disable the pixel change of the mouse position by slightly increase x and y of few pixels opposite to the menu(always showing to the right but you never know if the menu is shown up or down, don't forget a <kbd>right click</kbd> on a link open it directly with focus on that page.
 - A very little and only permit to show the right menus <kbd>click</kbd> without being closed, but usually and later its entirely possible to get them works or rebind them, with the same shortcut if necessary, it can be closed with much <kbd>keys and buttons</kbd>, it can too by a letter because they are underlined or if none was found menu is searched for the first matching same first letter and execute the entry command, this is another topic that require understand the way and the reason it is developed and positioned, the possibility to reuse it is possible.
 - More can select text, it can be done before/while script reload, but the selected text will be grayed out if the window focus is lost, and then next <kbd>left click</kbd> will delete it, not <kbd>right click</kbd> except if it does not change its position from the previous, it could append, remove parts of the select text or suppress it entirely of the selection, this can happens often in blue, white and gray, especially if use abuse of the <kbd>right click</kbd> while the <kbd>mouse-wheel</kbd>, nothing will be copied, its random and depend your previous focus if a default exists and elements though theses two points, like others that can break your copy operation, images and links hovered wit the mouse cancel the current selection, though codes boxes as text parts separated by other elements, you can now be sure the full text is preserved and selectable, simply remember, you not have to get already selected text but after first <kbd>left(or right) click</kbd>, simply never put the mouse hover links and images at any time, this ensure the selection will be entirely done though all two positions.
 - A very little longer time, the <kbd>key is down</kbd> then the current selected text is copied, selection cannot be changed there is no reload.
 - A longer <kbd>right click</kbd> can permit to show too the right context menus, use modifiers for more functionalities and be sure you can switch if there are multiples of them, usually you never know what is the next menus in Youtube, now it shows them together or cycle though all, like 3 without modifiers, one more time when on links in thumbnails.
 - A <kbd>click</kbd> very long permit to stay in a <kbd>scrolling</kbd> mode where it is made not on the page but on the *tabs*, the mode is not stopped by any <kbd>clicks</kbd> or something else, only the script reloading.
 - With Google chrome the <kbd>right click</kbd> in the window list can preserve the URL hibernation status when sent to another window, this is always the last concerned *tab* if there are more than one, a <kbd>longer right click</kbd>(or very short or <kbd>wheel</kbd> <kbd>up</kbd> not <kbd>down</kbd>) after a <kbd>right</kbd> made on the *tab* area to choose a next window permit to return to the first window, exactly the same way the long left, only hover the area of the *tabs*, can push out of the window the selected *tab(s)*, and eventually return back to the previous window.
 - <kbd>Right click</kbd> at two different points, select, open menu, then send your <kbd>letter</kbd> or choose your favorite entry, the menu should always near the mouse or the mouse will be moved and recovered with more positions before and after, eventually the page could move to fit the menu entirely always in the place where you opened it to get the first entry always near the mouse.

The only other undocumented advanced functionality available in the light version is the simplest domain matching system and a <kbd>wheel</kbd> without the circle, the first concern the position of the mouse at different moment on a website, by default, or by choices or by no other choice.

Much more documentation and menus will be available, actions between *tabs* are not that big idea, you can do much more like get or set pixel colors, reuse extension shortcuts, add a pause, delete something more than one time or in one time at exact position, maybe <kbd>click</kbd> not inside the pop-up but rather on its edges close it directly(while other extensions can show surrounding colored borders), create conditions or trigger actions like on all current URL(s) of the page.


> Little parenthesis : Dark theme
    ----

> It 's about another full, free and dynamic project to get full dynamic dark theme on the web 99.5% compatible and avoid cookies, pop-up, full page height, only colorize only the same, per domains and shortcut of shortcuts for test what script association you should choose, and then proceed to go to each script domain filtering configuration later, see latest update further in the concerned menus, this is about system shortcut and a browser extension that can load or unload CSS scripts per domain (with exceptions inside script only for frame types found, theses should always be surrounded by a blue border to identify them more easily.

> The dark theme and usage of this script works in a synergy, the free dark web theme in the same repositories account on Github, this is the same functionality to preserve the <kbd>scrolling</kbd> state of the <kbd>wheel</kbd> without have to keep pressed the key(s), any, this can happens too at two other moments, when you close a *tab* or you switched a *tab* in any mode *tab* switching mode you would prefer to use with.
    In fact the real activation of the<kbd>middle button</kbd> (w/o have to press the <kbd>middle mouse button</kbd>) of the mouse in a locked state is not available anywhere on the same areas on every websites of the world, let's divide any page into three proportional column areas in a page, the visual and interaction act differently :


 > 
 > Left of the page :
 + Project Darktheme: The darktheme can be compromised, more often there are less dark areas propagated(by default propagation of styles aim    almost always left to right and top to bottom)
 + Project CTM : The mouse activation with released keys is simply working the most of the time. 


 > 
 > Middle of the page :
 + Project Darktheme : The reading visibility is not much affected, multiple background and foreground contrast difference choices.
 + Project CTM : It result a bad area to try to send a <kbd>middle click</kbd> of the mouse, plus the <kbd>long left click</kbd> to open links in background that activate the auto <kbd>scrolling</kbd> is and can do both at the same time, at the origin it is made to open links by 2, it maybe differ by opening only one on videos websites, the search of a place to position the mouse in this state search several times an incremented coordinates in his combined axes to avoid the links to be <kbd>clicked</kbd>.


> 
> Right of the page :
 + Project Darktheme : The visibility contrast difference should be at the maximal, in fact it is the same of the left imaginary column, just sometimes the left column get less dark background changes variation at the same time from the same mouse localization.
 + Project CTM : The real problem is a big part of the websites in the INTERNET disable this area where the <kbd>buttons</kbd> are activated to <kbd>auto-scroll</kbd> later, you can't make anything against it, the mouse will return inevitably to the unused button state and the icon will be disabled too, in normal situation without this script the <kbd>middle mouse button</kbd> icon should not closed or reestablish(ed) by only the <kbd>wheel</kbd>(s).


> 
> You can easily conclude the ideal position often are in the same direction but not same sens, so record only an universal final position to activate the auto page scrolling is not satisfying, ideally the right side of the browser page should be not receptive and refuse to activate the <kbd>middle mouse button</kbd> into a half state, it is not impossible to get it working in a locked state, you must try a little more left and sometimes enter into the defined space as middle of the place or at least the next adjacent side of the main areas in an anodic website.


> The same functionality per domain in another way, on demand, often video websites require a focus for shortcuts to work correctly the first attempt, it could be really useful so you can decide a pixel coordinate at the concerned domain, it will be only for this to happens each times you switch to this *tab* or when the *tab* is no in a hibernated state, this can permit the very first shortcut to always works as expected instead try several of them for multiple operations, there is a repository in my account that demonstrate the usage of get pixel, this script show a limit of the set pixel, there are tons of functionalities with a get pixel color, activate an extension for the first time after a *tab* loaded, or detect if the *tab* background is a hibernated *tab* or no more hibernated, maybe certain extensions cannot know this information and do not activate firstly on newly created *tab*, so its the double consecutive and unique <kbd>left click</kbd>.



The left key permit to do this :
---

 - Double <kbd>left click</kbd> : Can start the opening of the links found in the system clipboard in the background, they load almost instantly if you added a prefix into the URL to load it as hibernated *tab*, it make load faster dozen of them and we need only wait around 1 second after to return to the last used *tab* because there is only one new used *tab*, the current is the first of all just opened, not the last.There will be choices to open all except the current domain.
 - Make the page <kbd>auto-scroll</kbd> active, no need <kbd>clicks</kbd> it happens when a *tab* was closed or switched, both are options.
 - Use an <kbd>auto-scroll</kbd> identical but without move the mouse and before 150 ms are elapsed.
 - By default the selection hover certain different adjacent element does not bring back the selection in the clipboard and/or in the selection view that highlights the parts, certain can miss if the selection is not reverted or if the mouse encounter link and images or if the operation is simply impossible, with this you can do it in any order, firstly it can be broken exactly in the same viewable ways, so to enhance the idea, i added a shortcut in the light version of this program, it can help you to copy all you need, do not loose a part or copy redundant data, get all the text from certain text or code boxes, not only what is viewable directly selected but the rest is not selected, do not cancel the operation while and where the mouse move, reuse directly that data into the <kbd>right click</kbd> menu.
 - Right and middle, the only shortcut exception to use two mouse button at the same time with difficulty, call a sort of circle with only the rays and between them the triangles full of choices that you can set to be the default action and/or call another wheel of triangles, a configuration mode to set up them all in one drawing on the screen, include text, icons and status in the corners of the triangles.
 - (triple <kbd>click</kbd> or longer)Call the same default mouse position but only in the full version, this record is not accessible in a wheel of choices, theses execute only in the light version any script you would and its parameters to demonstrate it will be included later in the full version, it can really be directly the triple key or the previous first line pop-up where the mouse it set over the goto button, or you can use the only another button reset the position to the next <kbd>click</kbd>, or <kbd>escape</kbd> pop-up with the <kbd>wheel up</kbd> or <kbd>wheel down</kbd> keys.
 - Others operations with modifiers on other elements, per example links can download the web page at this location, it depend the browser and if you desire, normally theses key combos are never made by default or by extensions, so it's safe to let it configured on activated at start, the full list of functionnalities can be found on other pages of this Github project.



Right + left
---

 - Close the *tab*, could works in any other application of your choice just like the <kbd>wheel</kbd> can be multiplied or the <kbd>right + wheel up</kbd> or <kbd>wheel down</kbd> can send like in sublime text editor and much other applications, <kbd>control + tab</kbd> and <kbd>control + shift + tab</kbd>, this is not the only most common combos, this is more about another project uncovered.
 - You can choose to pass by a pop-up where the mouse pointer is already hover the <kbd>yes button</kbd>, there is a <kbd>no button</kbd> and the pop-up close it self after a short time, if you keep the <kbd>right click</kbd> down until the left become a <kbd>status to up</kbd>, there will be no pop-up.



Left + right
---

 - <kbd>left down + right down</kbd> is not covered here
 - <kbd>left down right down left up</kbd>
 - <kbd>left down right down right up</kbd>
 - <kbd>left + right + left</kbd> is not covered here
 - <kbd>left + right</kbd> is not covered here



 # <kbd>Double left</kbd>
---
There are 2 double left:
 - Retrieve the ideal position and status of the mouse for in general or the current website or by a user script conditions.
 - slowly and longer = one of the simplest gsearch mode, for that see all the way to google overidden usages.
With a wrong timing, it can produce a <kbd> double </kbd> , and activate the highlight mode ON.

 # <kbd>Triple left</kbd>, all consecutive only and under a little time between them :
---
 - Fast for open urls found in the clipboad(multiples formats and editions are possible)



Middle button
---

 - Keep windows you like by using the <kbd>scroll</kbd> in them to regroup them with the same shortcut combos and different modifiers, <kbd>control + shift + wheel(s)</kbd>, you can assign a name to the windows, the list stay always ordered but you can open an input that filter the window list and assign a name or goto or separate the window of the list of windows you switch by the modifiers and the wheel(s).
 - Simply press it and directly after, only, use the <kbd>wheel</kbd> can displace the *tab* position without change the current *tab*, works well even in always <kbd>scroll</kbd> the *tabs*, there will be no doubles.
 - Open links as usual in the background as new *tabs* unfocused.
 - <kbd>Wheel</kbd> multiplied inside and outside, default is 4X, in fact in any application you would this script or only this functionality, exception with sublime text where the <kbd>right + wheel</kbd> is a native keys detection.



Circle of choices(left + right)
---

 - Override a new default domain website mouse position you would prefer it should be, or at least to be when you come back to the tab and change mouse position to any final point, when you want switch the *tab* or close a *tab* or manually on demand.
 - Execute new AHK scripts on the fly.
 - Ask an amount of tabs to use a shortcut or a script, normally a script it self could be enough to ask like one of these answer:
  + Hibernate/Unhibernate/only hibernate unhibernated/only unhibernate hibernated "x" *tab(s)*
  + Check the pixel color of an extension on any page, i have a good extension and it does not show it by default in new tabs, this could consider a personnal list of domain and matching type to be a conditionnal prerequesite.
  + Other extensions...


The wheel and last advices
---

 - In the full version with the source, you could reuse it like any other application, just the cost is undetermined(ex discord switch servers, channels or users).

 - The status of the <kbd>numpad</kbd> lock must be set on, it could be more problematic to not use it at the status on, or it could send top or bottom  of the page, page reload infinitely while being always at end of the page; just considerate this script could necessity it but could accept or switch it later, anyway there is a the necessity to handle it the most of the time to a fixed locked state.
 Same example with <kbd>Escape</kbd>, it's about another functionality, the fact <kbd>Esc</kbd> pressed 0.5 second active or deactivate a new mode, this mode can support search URLs domains and handle the F and special characters lines to allow them to continue you researches of the associated words,(F1=1 F2=2 etc or &=1 é=2... or 1=! 2=@...), this not require to lock the <kbd>Escape</kbd> key, you can continue to use it as normally and all others keys too, the mode does not deactivate itself, just remember too the <kbd>shiftlock</kbd> can be used instead and it does not require to be in a locked state.

 - If the script block the clipboard of the system, i suggest you to access the notification area icon and make a <kbd>right click</kbd> on the program icon, note anything else without firstly lose focus of the browser window will fail, only the <kbd>right click</kbd> key down for 4 seconds can reload it(4 for clipboard and 5 for the program), eventually you can close and restart it.

 - <kbd>^!+</kbd> + <kbd>wheel up</kbd> or <kbd>wheel down</kbd> can goto next or all previous browser no grouped windows even if no used(made auto by <kbd>scroll up or down</kbd> except when you send a *tab* to another window by the <kbd>right click</kbd> until <kbd>wheel</kbd> or <kbd>clicks</kbd> happens, there is no time left to reset the status of this mode).
  - By default change the current browser other windows can be made with <kbd>left + wheel up or down</kbd>, or call the list of named windows with <kbd>control + space</kbd>, then type letters and finish with <kbd>enter</kbd>, the last entry will be selected first !, otherwise simply press <kbd>*tab*</kbd> to choose manually a selected entry with <kbd>up or down</kbd> keys.
  - <kbd>Left click + wheel up</kbd>= Switch to the very last browser application window(or switch into all others different browser types and windows after the last scrolled, but only scrolled windows).
  - <kbd>Left click + wheel down</kbd>(inside or outside)= will always goto to the one more used window but from the system historic of last used application, it could be another browser or the same, this will switch the before last window or one more last window earlier.
 <kbd>Control + shift wheel up</kbd> Return firstly to the very last application window in the grouped browser windows,
 and the next windows will come from the last used in the ungrouped windows, so the window that are deleted from the grouped group or that has not been scrolled even if used or switched.
  - <kbd>Alt + shift + wheel up</kbd> is delete the windows of the default and only main group.
  - <kbd>Alt + shift + wheel down</kbd> add all others ungrouped windows into the main, in the end and return to the first used of them.


But there are exceptions :
 - Take the example you have under the focus a browser window, grouped or ungrouped, if you use <kbd>alt + shift + wheel up</kbd> and then <kbd>alt + shift + wheel down</kbd>(preferably by releasing the modifier keys and press them again between the wheel sens), this window will be ungrouped but the exception is when <kbd>scrolled</kbd> the window will not be added into the grouped windows.(only 1 window, the next other window(s) will act as usually).

 - Remember too the <kbd>control + shift + wheel up</kbd> will firstly go to the last used grouped windows(yes because <kbd>left + up and down</kbd> for goto the grouped windows can cycle +1 or -1 window position directly), and then the <kbd>second wheel up</kbd> and further goto the list of ungrouped windows.(this can disabled itself after a moment of inactivity of the <kbd>left + mouse wheel up or down</kbd> from outside and inside any browser window(s)).

 - The previous and last used windows at the system level are made of <kbd>control + alt + wheel up or down</kbd>.

 - Finally <kbd>control + shift + wheel down</kbd> does nothing.

You can too at any moment use either the <kbd>control + space</kbd> or <kbd>shift + space</kbd> to call the list of windows with their title(with a filter, <kbd>special chars</kbd> and <kbd>numpad keys</kbd> as last bind), keep <kbd>space</kbd> longer down to use the list of ungrouped window(s) else it's the grouped window(s) list, they can both be disabled in the configuration for the access from the outside of a browser window, or completely disabled, just <kbd>control + space</kbd> can get it's other windows exception list, <kbd>shift + space</kbd> can be annoying when you write in capitals and <kbd>control + space</kbd> is often used in development softwares and games.

All the shortcuts works for only the same browser executable, except when all the <kbd>modifiers</kbd> are with <kbd>the mouse wheel</kbd>, but it's all it does.

 All the previous window shortcuts(except last windows and from outside the browsers only) are disabled in a video mode that can be used to switch rapidly different usages :
 - Speed
 - Volume
 - Slow or fast Backward/Forward
 - Previous/Next chapter
 This mode is not to take seriously, the keyboard layout and disposition is really different on a low amount of main different video content platforms, certain use modifiers while other use more custom shortcut or unique(s) way(s) to do the same final aim, use a basic function without know it.
 Another functionality, they are myriads of them, based with a domain filtering more sophisticated than retrieve the simplest usual or working domain name for only one website, should permit to reach the potential maximal numbers of the same shortcut in any circumstance.

Send *tabs* to windows and come back can be done with the <kbd>wheels</kbd> too, up for come back not <kbd>wheel down</kbd>, just like left is normal but short right will not un-hibernate a hibernated *tab*, in chrome only, this is due to the fact it simulate something like <kbd>shift</kbd> and <kbd>click</kbd>.

Press and hold the left <kbd>button</kbd> hover *tabs* if they are in the application title-bar, this should eject them outside the window into another, even if the *tabs* are grouped, this works in chrome based browser, to not have to use the send *tab* to another window list in the menus into one new window entry, simply keep the <kbd>left click</kbd> pressed longer to return back to the previous used window.

Remember there are other combo with <kbd>left or right</kbd> and other mouse keys but not <kbd>backward</kbd> and <kbd>forward</kbd>, they will be inexact and inaccurate not only due to the <kbd>numpad</kbd> status key(s).

There is a possibility to open x links(and return to the last used *tab*) in the background but once again, its more the resort of other extension(s) or script(s), you could prefer copy a list of links and simply make them compatible by reusing the title and the URL into the URL, like this with an extension that last in that way in any loading proper state of hibernated or no hibernated *tab(s)*, the difficulty is to say if open all of that into one command is possible to run on your computer, text could be too long with many *tabs*, but loading should be instantly made, and the origin a simple copy or selected text with an extension that search the links, the title could the link text before the first loading time and a hibernation, like this it can be right or <kbd>left click</kbd> start of text, <kbd>right click</kbd> then show the menu and select your extension and then copy in the clipboard the links, they can be opened like hibernated *tabs* into one new window or the current content from the clipboard,(eventually from the input in the full version), you need only URLs not title lines, this could be part of further formatting updates, usually *tab* opening are made with universal shortcuts and timers between other shortcut(s) can make them open one by one in the foreground.
 Note on Mac PC there are others system command line launcher (can select a specific profile too) that can force the opening to occurs in a no focused window, so in the background, other extensions stop working as usual...

In the full version you can considerate create a very short script is not a secret for you, and , reuse functionalities based on an constant and sure value of the retrievals of your complete current list of *tabs* and their associated URLs, anyway this will not provide any shortcut made by only the keyboard, you must reuse the last functionality that permit to reuse the mouse inside areas designed to be separated like parts of a cake with the mouse in the <kbd>middle</kbd> and the choice you made from the center to the first colored places that execute an predefined set of actions(like a <kbd>wheel</kbd>), execution of scripts(the only type of selectable parts in visuals <kbd>wheels</kbd> in the light version of the script), add text and icons to recognize the parts, the wheels are fully reusable as overlay(s).

If you prefer for get your favorite browser you can set the magic <kbd>wheel</kbd> shortcut that are other shortcuts with one that is set the default choice and can be a single key too, shared keys per multiples <kbd>wheel</kbd> can be done or avoid though the re-usage, configuration of the <kbd>wheels</kbd> layouts.

Open a certain amount of URLs in background is easy but it could be truncated into multiple opening operation if there are too many URLs at the same time, It may depend of your system limitation but its rather the configuration or the limits of the computing language usages usual, so there will be an additional delay intentionally, note even open 100 *tabs* in a row in chrome should not load them at the same speed even if empty and no data about them.

Choose extension working in the flow of execution in the full version concern more the editor, example with load/switch some *tabs* one by one so you have time to do something or nothing between each new *tab* loading, is maybe required as the default behavior suggest already a pause is necessary, hibernate a *tab* or display a headings map of all important titles in a web-page in the free space is not natively supported in all browsers, the browser, the extensions, the websites, are all potential valid candidate to be the perfect moment of matching and missing crucial values to execute or not the same or the next actions of the needs pursuit that are really more dynamics and BTW are lose partially and momently.


Principals extensions :
___

 - https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/link-to-text-fragment/pbcodcjpfjdpcineamnnmbkkmkdpajjg
 - Hover and copy for handle <kbd>ctrl-c</kbd> in chrome (not "hover copy" extension name)
 - Set tab width to reduce all tab width to almost an icon and/or(same config=not same size) until few letters :)
 - The marvellous suspender to get chrome nice hibernated tabs even after updates.


 - copy URLs
 - open selected links
 - copy selected links
 - link grabber

 - Stylus
 - Adblock or Ublock origin to delete element permanently
 - Google translate plus
 - Session buddy
 - context deleters
 - click to remove element
 - magic actions for youtube (mycinemapro)
 - cycle input focus plus

 - Quickkey - the quick tab switcher
 - headings map

Eventual extensions :
___

 - Tab menu
 - Tabs search
 - Move tab to next window
 - Tab resize
 - pin tab
 - humble new tab page


The extension set *tab* width, permit to lower the length of all *tabs*, it reduce the text length and can shrink the *tab* until its icon is only visible, even if the scroll hover the *tab* bar area can works with a flag activated.

But recently this *tab* could divide your *tab* opening in two *tabs*, the old and the new, you can change it manually by using the only shortcut proposed, problem is access to the shortcut is no more available, i don't remember the default shortcut, i put <kbd>control + x</kbd> , the development stopped since years, if the extension was made with a manifest in the version 2 it will be stopped in January 2023, if you click a *tab* and its full length it can be moved only though other similar *tab* length and there is no way to know what's the *tab* length before apply an additional shortcut when you want use that *tab*.

Last good new is you can configure it differently by using the authorization option on all websites not only per clicks, this permit to have only automatic reduced *tab* lengths; exceptionally you could get a *tab* with its full length.


A great extension while waiting final releases(chrome only)
___

I can highly propose you to install another extension yet, normally their will be much extension with script proposed in the light and full version, waiting the releases you can use quick keys, it can do this :
 - <kbd>Alt + q</kbd> = Show a list of *tabs*, there are other extensions for other sortings.
 - <kbd>Alt + a</kbd> = Switch to the previous *tab*
 - <kbd>Alt + s</kbd> = Switch to the next used *tab*
 - <kbd>Alt + z</kbd> = Switch between two last used *tabs*

This can preserve you to send much <kbd>mousewheel</kbd>.
The support of all browsers will be possible, only Firefox and chrome FTM, but not all will get the default behavior of all others to compensate it's lack of functionalities.


Example of outdated extensions ideas
___

 - Any navigator, ex : link-fixer, restores consistent <kbd>ctrl + click</kbd>, <kbd>shift + click</kbd>, <kbd>cmd + click</kbd> and <kbd>middle-click</kbd> behavior when clicking links. 
 - Chrome only, Humble copy, seems only copy links not on shortcut with when hovering and systematically.
