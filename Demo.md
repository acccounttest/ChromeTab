CHROME TAB MOUSE DEMO
---------------------

Demo of the compiled version of the program to control and distinguish without ambiguity the different devices and their shortcuts in a row, in a browser, they all share a majority of keys, but it could be websites that does not share them too in the worst scenario.
Consider this without configuration accessible, it is partially working and not completely done, in a future, every instruction will be modifiable though a configuration UI of each parts of any section of the whole script, like if you want to make it compatible for any another browser by the keys, timing, config and instructions types, it will be very easily doable to remade or switch and replace any section of instructions, note this is really not to suggest, as you will be not allowed to modify the entrance of the section itself, not especially its main condition, but more it's place related to others sections indirectly and certainly more than 2.

- Send tab to window=left while scroll down but keep last key down for better results, if you move it could be added to a new group and choose the color
- Change tab=<kbd>right</kbd> while <kbd>scrolls</kbd> or only <kbd>scroll(s)</kbd> after a <kbd>short right click</kbd>(reload), or the <kbd>wheel</kbd> without <kbd>scroll(s)</kbd> for 1 second, the <kbd>right click</kbd> is sensible for copypaste, see the cheatsheets page.
- Move tab=<kbd>Middle click</kbd> and immediately scroll even before animation occurs, they will be taken in account later
- Close a tab=close is <kbd>right while left</kbd> in that order only.
- New tab=New is in the magicwheel <strike>is <kbd>left while scroll up</kbd></strike>.
- Scroll immediately = <kbd>average left</kbd>, can be pressed over a URL or under after maybe another link.
- Open a link in current tab= normal <kbd>short left</kbd> click.
- Open in new background= <kbd>middle click</kbd> or <kbd>average left</kbd> click, keep it pressed longer than usually no need 1 second.
- Open directly= <kbd>right click</kbd>(short or long same).
- Dl a link(works or not)<kbd>control shift</kbd> <kbd>short left click</kbd>.
- Always scroll= <kbd>long right click</kbd> a second OR short right click followed by scrolls almost immediately(reload the script and always scroll canceled by a normal right click or a reload and no scroll after).
- After a middle click for move a tab, <kbd>left</kbd> click will return to the last selected tab while the <kbd>right</kbd> will not do that.
- Disable the script temporally by <kbd>right</kbd> while <kbd> middle click</kbd> in this order only and simply, the only combo of the middle mouse and its buttons.
- Select text only by <kbd>two right clicks</kbd>, continue or reinit selection start with a <kbd>single left</kbd> if it blocks.
-

All shortcuts are available only in chrome.exe, only 2 are accessible outside the Chrome windows, <kbd>right while left</kbd>(in this order) for send <kbd>ctrl+w</kbd> is doable everywhere else, and <kbd>left while right</kbd> to activate shortcuts(shortcut only not script but it could but unnecessary) or the invert, deactivate them all except the two concerned, by using <kbd> right </kbd> + <kbd> middle click </kbd>, this is only used for disabled them, or use the magicwheel you start by the previous shortcut that restablish the shortcuts pause.

Remember a <kbd>short right click</kbd> can reload potentially the script and loose partially information of current status or other data until the script remains unfinished or in a demo version like here.
Don't forget enter a mode can stay blocked in it and could require to use same or others shortcut to exit.

For search on Google or any sites and highlight previous selected words or sentences(auto on Google by ... and longer char - for delete dates), unfinished, there are multiple Google search modes constantly evolving:
For enter to this mode simply press a <kbd>long left</kbd> followed by another shorter, a popup should briefly appear, and only in these timing of these keys.
- <kbd>Scroll up</kbd> in text= select a word or continue to select only by the right to the current selected line.
- <kbd>Scroll down</kbd> in text= copy the text
- <kbd>Scroll up</kbd> in a URL= add in stack to unload them all with control shift u (note jsut control u could works but could call instead open the source view in a new tab)
- <kbd>Scroll down</kbd> in a URL= open it immediately with all previous select texts
- <kbd>Left click</kbd> select all text and try to get more highlights than expected or wanted, it will positionate the cursor hover the URL link, now process as usually.
- Simply press the <kbd>scroll up</kbd>key for add in the stack and down for execute immedialty.
- Press <kbd>control shift u</kbd> for execute the stack and empty it.

Note open a new link, but for highlight text, is not in a new tab but in a new window, this is due the new tab could be white or blank depending your system preferences, i suggest you an extension for open a new tab, you can open it in a new window with the <kbd>shift key</kbd> too.

The highlight of fragment still relatively in working state and cannot be serious for usage of multiple and/or prefix and suffix, that are only important for the start text tag not the end tag.

The concept can be followed by an adept to a Reddit, just i did not yet explain him well why the characters and the usage change in the same time.

Tips: Don't try to quit and enter in the chrome instantly researching another key or action, it could fail or act differently than expected on your system...
Tips2:On Google URLS and strange domain names with many words and/or very short text parts, it could redirect and there are many chances that break the functionality or the tab loading can stay in paused state.

  > **Only the keys in the demo document are available for functionnalitites, the keys of the main readme project are not well explained, certain are old or inverted, just the actions are fine per devices or approximately, more with only a mouse are working.**

  > It will be possible to use another functionnality not explained in the readme, at tab state or betwen them(any or from a list), i have much extension that could require a user operation or a shortcut or start a script, this is not intended to list and automate all shortcuts for all domains, just click and modify extension of chrome though domains in less a second or something else, like reorder a process of execution of extensions at a moment, example with higlights that could rewrite themselves too often or not enough, example with extensions stylish and headings map, i will shown examples and other extensions.

  > Installation and configuration will be later added here.

  > Latest functionnalitites come from inintentionnal and coincidential stuff, access the chrome URL scheme area and paste the clipboard content is an example.

  > Note:
This document cover only the first section of the shortcut devices types combined or not, but the code compiled included all headers and all keys, just the highlight search still in development.
