Why, How, When
---

Do not have to use the keyboard to navigate for almost all essentials moves and actions, usually the links are not associated with their action, where they want open and where they will be, now every links should open by default to a new tab, at the difference the right click goto the new opened tab and the normal click open in current tab, the short left is outside.


There is absolutely no keys to press consecutively with up status just after the same key status was down, excepted double +, double !, double MMB, and all their combinations that require the letter key to be pressed all during the pressions of the modifers after and certain modifiers. 


Only when the mouse is inside the appropriated chrome windows, the last current window, but sometimes one or more windows stay under focus when looking at their title bar, the icon that should change only in chrome can be see outside sometimes, not all icons but more the most common, the ring but not turning.
When you want, you can deactivate it with an improbable shortcut made for it, ! MMB


Intro
---

Windows and chrome only for the moment, Firefox should not be difficult to add to it but i think move the current tab is not same shortcuts or possibilities by default, if you have an extension to pilot your tabs, it could be necessary to modify it.


It can be necessary to reload the script if certain functionalities shortcuts stop working, simply press a short right click, not a long or a normal.



Functionalities working with only mouse wheel without keyboard.
---

 - Change current tab
 - Move a tab
 - Close a tab, even with multiples windows, to be sure its the very last effective window.
 - New tab
 - Keep always left mouse like a mouse wheel you can graduate, it's a switch but with less or more arrows(like in full screen)
 - Goto up of the page smoothly or greatly a right clic then move up the mouse, or use ^home for instant actions without text that remains eventually selected before or after.
 - Open last backward forward in a new tab.
 - Always open a link like a control+left click with a simple usual and short left click.
 - Always open a link like goto to the tab directly with right click
 - Always open a link in current tab with a normal click released , do not take it longer or other functionnality not expected following the domains it happened.(should not but could necessite the alt key)
 - Control shift left click can dl a link page, often named like the link.
 - The mode always control can permit you to close a tab on its title bar by pressing a single right click, a normal left press means take focus, a short left close it too.(but in configuration you can modify behaviour of mouse click in the tabbar area coordinates.)
 - A way to move into the page screen in any sens and direction with a single click as a switch.(MMB but no need keep it down constantly).
 - Change cursor icon and change it if the time necessite to show it.
 - Copy all the code though all boxes of codes together or not directly, accept scrolling into code parts more easily and quit them with unique direction of the mouse position, like selection will always continue to select all to the end from, though and in it, in because if only selection outside for the first line and outside for the last line, often the selected parts without this script are incomplete visually perceived or not, much more often not.
 - Return back to the last tab moved after left right, right click cancel the tab change after a tab move.
 - Right click a line can copy it, or a word more often if you are hovering letters directly, select very fast word, sentence ,paragraph and bloc, scroll in the code is allowed.
 - Permit to continuously to scroll down even if a menu is present under the mouse position(or not if you come to the tab or moved not directly the mouse, example: use chrome GUI.
 - Change video chapter and timeline(sometimes only in fullscreen, or volume too but it's random)
 - Invert the contrast of the selected text(can be a complement to partially zzz dark theme CSS script as last resort), white on blue or dark on gray background, the context menu tend to lose the focus any selected parts differently, can depend extensions.
 - Get less and less the same chrome right menu, that can be cause of annoying white frame over dark theme on older platforms.
 - Get the secondary menu for videos or chrome browser or extensions more often in cycles with empty cycle step, or modifiers.
 - Multiply the number of scroll at same time
 - Add an enhanced scroll instead the scroll in google page, scroll google(sincerely why but sometimes due to something more or more it could as normally disappear or never appears, differently i have two ext that produce it sometimes more than expected)
 - Deactivate temporally all shortcuts by a unique shortcut, shift+MMB.
 - Differentiate more all default shortcuts that were not working or you never used or you would change because the default are not the only possible or depending the platform(or more or less new keys).
 - Permit do the same in a set of tabs in a row(it's an expression, it means all consecutively without breaking the scroll of the page, but menus should be forget, they are completely possible but usually tend to quit while the tab lose the focus.)
 - Capacity to supress top right buttons of each windows
 - Goto page bottom very fast
 - Help to show more colors and visual content during the longer left click, example on the chrome store, the square tend to be more highlighted after the click than with the middle one, same apply for right click and is more website default color dependant, ex: selected areas colors.
 - Goto horizontally always better(in web and generally) with shift+scroll, but anyway move vertically to avoid or force the goto was not necessary and not being before.
 - The backward and forward middle click on the GUI can lose your tabs and not load the appropriate historic of the tabs, much status key in this case, all shortcuts could not be available in all keyboard or even accessible on a full keyboard(Numpad or directional keys or other type(s) of keys). Not all shortcuts could or are available in the same time.
 - Sometimes change chapter or timeline change a volume,(not when it was partially or completely the shortcut for it), add or remove a key in the combo.
 - Activate a easy shortcut to activate temporally the drag and drop with the left click to not loose all capabilities always or retry to use the difficult shortcut of process the activation/deactivation of the whole script, this permit on certains icons to continue as normally, resize icon types, frames, drag and drop etc(combination of left and right together all the necessary time, next choose for repeat quickly the same operation or as normally need press the same shortcut) 
 - Choose to close or not a right menu to be closed if you decide to scroll the page.
 - Break directional middle mouse arrows with the scroll.
Reactivate of the right menu on tabs by using control and right click(s) one time, one right click or a long left click close it too, if you want configuration can help you.
Add a configuration entirely remade for any shortcuts with a detailed list of what shortcut is already taken or not outside the program, and inside it switch values possible for the same properties(shortcut=functionality value, sometimes on/off or sometimes multiples values, values can be overridden, any change save the file.)



The unique functionalities with keyboard combined with the mouse or only keyboard:
---

 - Alt or control +left click or short click= normal click(Alt is specific to several different times not coded in this script, normally it block mouse buttons, but now it can do much more things, dl a page, goto in current tab from a link, open in a tab focussed or not, with links you have choices to press it before to be on the link and when you open it, it differ in functionality in every websites, only in links, it can be a link but this one is managed in JS, much less chances to produce something new.), the control and the shift key automatically can dl a link page.
 - Alt+MMB for configuration
 - Double shift for activate/deactivate, is default and remains default on reload(follow config).
 - Same for Alt
 - Shift +right click for activate mode 2(one of the useless modes)
 - Add a way to move faster the CSS resize anchor icon as double diagonal in the corner, sometimes to the left to disappear sometimes to the right and/or bottom to growth it.
 - Middle mouse button is not replaced and works as normally.
